Hey there!
I am a first-year PhD Student at the <a href="https://dsv.su.se">Department of Computer and Systems Sciences</a>, <a href="https://su.se">Stockholm Unversity</a> in Stockholm, Schweden.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the <a href="https://www.isi.hhu.de/en/departments/department-of-information-science">Department of Information Science</a> and on a project about Research Data Management at <a href="https://www.hhu.de/en/">Heinrich Heine University</a> in Düsseldorf, Germany. Before, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at the <a href="https://www.isi.hhu.de/en/departments/department-of-information-science">Department of Information Science</a> at <a href="https://www.hhu.de/en/">Heinrich Heine University</a> as well.

I am interested in researching XR (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality), Information Seeking and Retrieval and Human-Computer Interaction. Feel free to get in touch about this or other things!
