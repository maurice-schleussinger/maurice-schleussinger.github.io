This not true. It may not be an entirely optimal process, but it is very much possible.

And it would be the prefered way for development, since you jump very quickly into the VR scence with Unity’s play mode.</p> <p>But, you can do the latter. And with the good performance for build times on Apple Silicon Macs. To do so, you need to switch to the Android platform in Unity’s Build Settings and select the appropriate XR Plug-in in the Project Settings (both OpenXR and Oculus should work). Afterwards build and run the project. Also make sure that the Oculus Quest 2 is selected as the Run Device in the Build Settings:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Unity-Quest2-ARM/build-settings-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Unity-Quest2-ARM/build-settings-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Unity-Quest2-ARM/build-settings-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Unity-Quest2-ARM/build-settings.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This is a viable way of building more simple projects and testing things on the go. A simplistic demo scene builds on my baseline MacBook Pro (M1, 2020) in about 12 seconds (with Unity 2021.3.5f1 SILICON LTS). I image that build times would be even lower with the high-performance versions of Apple Silicon (M2, M1 Pro/Max/Ultra).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="software-development"/><category term="virtual-reality"/><category term="Unity"/><category term="Oculus"/><category term="Quest-2"/><category term="Mac"/><category term="M1"/><category term="M2"/><category term="Apple-Silicon"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most online resources claim that it is not possible to develop for the Meta Quest 2 in Unity with Apple Silicon Macs (such as my 2020 Macbook Pro with a M1 ARM chip).
